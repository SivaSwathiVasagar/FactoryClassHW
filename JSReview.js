///////////////////////  Part II: JavaScript Reps ///////////////
// Easy Going
// Write a for loop that will log the numbers 1 through 20.
for (let i = 0; i <= 20; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

////////  Get Even  /////////////
// Write a for loop that will log only the even numbers in 0 through 200.

// Hint: Think about the increment expression.

for (let i = 0; i <= 200; i++) {

////////// Fizz Buzz  /////////////
// This is a classic problem that you should get really comfortable solving. If you've solved it before, try to make it more elegant and short.

// Write a javascript application that logs all numbers from 1 - 100.
// If a number is divisible by 3 log "Fizz" instead of the number.
// If a number is divisible by 5 log "Buzz" instead of the number.
// If a number is divisible by 3 and 5 log "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

function FizzBuzz(num){
   if((num%3 == 0) && (num%5 == 0)){
      return "Fizzbuzz";
   }
   else if( num % 5 == 0){
      return "Buzz ";
   }
   else(num % 3 == 0){
      return "Fizz";
   }

// Plantee just had her birthday; change Plantee's array to reflect her being a year older.
// Change Wolfy's hometown from "Yukon Territory" to "Gotham City".

////////////////// Yell at the Ninja Turtles
// Create an array with the members of the ninja turtles (Donatello, Leonardo, Raphael, Michaelangelo)
// Use a for of loop(not a typo - try it out! Try a for ofloop) to call toUpperCase()on each of them and print out the result.

// Console log: the index of Titanic
// Do the following and console.log the final results (I have included some thought questions, you don't have to write out an answer for those marked as such):
// Note: if you have to add to the array, feel free to add any movie you'd like

// use the .sortmethod Thought question: what did this do to the array? Did it permanently alter it?
// Use the method pop
// push"Guardians of the Galaxy"
// Reverse the array
// Use the shiftmethod
// unshift- what does it return?
// splice"Django Unchained" and add "Avatar" (try finding the index of "Django Unchained", instead of counting it yourself) Thought question: did this permanently alter our array?
// slicethe last half of the array (challenge yourself and try to programatically determine the middle of the array rather than counting it and hard coding it) - Thought question: did this permanently alter our array?
// store the value of your slicein a variable, console.log it - Thought question: what is going on here?
// console.log your final results
// After running the above tasks, console.log the index of "Fast and Furious" -We removed it from the array, what value do we get when we look for the index of something that is not in the array?
// Thought question: that we declared the variable favMovieswith const, and yet, we were allowed to change the array. Weird? Should we have used let?
